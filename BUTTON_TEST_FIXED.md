Even with the basic test screen, you can:

### **Identify Current Issues:**
- **Slow button response** - Notice any delays in current buttons
- **Animation stuttering** - See if animations are smooth
- **Memory usage** - Monitor with React Native debugger
- **User experience** - Feel the current responsiveness level

### **Prepare for Optimization:**
- **Baseline metrics** - Know your starting point
- **Problem areas** - Identify which buttons need optimization most
- **Testing methodology** - Establish how to measure improvements
- **Migration planning** - Plan which screens to optimize first

## 🚀 **Ready to Test!**

The button performance test screen is now working and ready to use. While we work on resolving the module resolution issues for the optimized components, you can:

1. **Test your current button performance**
2. **Establish baseline metrics**
3. **Identify areas for improvement**
4. **Plan the optimization rollout**

Navigate to **Settings → Developer Preview → Button Performance Test** to get started! 🎯
